Juvenile Delinquency Model
======================

This is a simulation project designed to study the effect of policy on Juvenile Delinquency rate within a predefined community. It is developed by three undergraduate students: Allen Nie (team leader, and main programmer), Qi Wu (Sociology student, research analyst), Guhan Wang (data collection) in Emory University, under the advisory of Dr. M.J. Prietula.

For anyone who wants to check out the model or modify it, the language is NetLogo. Here you can find its official website:

This model is already published in NetLogo Modeling Commons:
http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/3952

Also you can find our research paper attached in. Our BehaviorSpace experiment data is seperated from our paper and is downloadable as well.

Things to notice: we are proud of our work, but it doesn't mean it is perfect. In fact, one of the greatest imperfection comes from the foundation this model is built upon: Agnewâ€™s book *Juvenile Delinquency: Causes and Control*. We don't want to question the validity of her work, but converting a pure statistical model into a program risks with inaccuracy. If time allows, we would rather conduct our own experiment.

Full documentation can be found inside the program (inside research folder).
